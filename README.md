# Data-on-Disk

Once again, completely revised with the objective of helping the coder quickly IDENTIFY and USE the module functions we need
to get the job done. This version compactly and succintly condenses the standard read and write functions.  One educator calls
this top pannel "the best condensed reference and explaination of any complex Python process ever".  After that comes the
big change.  Centered around moving to pathlib whenever possible, we still look at sys, os, os.path, shutil, and glob to find
the most commonly needed functions, then abbreviated those to their essentials and grouped all of them by one of four activity
headers. Page 2 now holds our 7 techniques for reading a file and short overviews of pickle, shelve sqlite3, csv, json, filecmp,
fileinput, and the compression modules.
